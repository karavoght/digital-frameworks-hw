## Congressman Biography: Representative Thomas Garrett, Jr.

Thomas Garrett Jr.—known colloquially as Tom Garrett—represents Virginia's fifth congressional district. Born in Atlanta in 1972, Garrett received both his undergraduate (1994) and law degrees (2002) from the University of Richmond. At the conclusion of his undergraduate education but prior to enrolling in law school, Garrett served as an Army officer for six years, achieving the level of Captain. He retired and ran for the position of Commonwealth’s Attorney, serving in that role for four years before gaining a seat in the Virginia Senate in 2011, representing Virginia’s 22nd senatorial district. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Buckingham County, Virginia.

Garrett’s district encompasses portions of central Virginia, including University of Virginia college town Charlottesville.  The district is among the country’s 108 “Pivot Counties,” districts in which the majority voted for Barack Obama in 2012, but cast their votes for Donald Trump in 2016.  Garrett acquired the seat formerly held by Representative Robert Hurt (R), who retired at the conclusion of the 2015-2017 term, defeating first-time candidate Jane Dittmar (D) to gain the seat with 58 percent of the vote. During the campaign, Garrett faced criticism after a 2005 video of him condemning President Trump’s lewd comments were broadly shared in the media. He serves on the House Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs, and Education and the Workforce Committees. He has sponsored 99 bills in the first months of his freshman term, introducing measures like the President-Elect Release of Tax Return Act of 2017 and the Student Security Act of 2017. His votes frequently align with President Trump’s positions according to vote tracking performed by FiveThirtyEight, deviating only on matters related to the 2017 fiscal year appropriations bill and the June 28 vote to limit health care lawsuits related to coverage provided through a federal program—President Trump supported these measures, Representative Garrett did not.
